👋 Hello, I'm Shwet Saoji! a graduate student at San Diego State University majoring in Computer Science.

I'm a software engineer with 4 years of experience building scalable, high-performance applications. My expertise includes building ETL pipeline, Data Warehousing and software development life cycle and I'm always excited to learn about new tools and technologies.

On my Github, you can find a variety of projects that showcase my abilities and experience. From data processing and analysis projects, to software development projects using languages like C++, Python, and JavaScript as well as some machine learning projects such as predictive modeling, computer vision and natural language processing.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing ukulele, hiking and cooking. I am actively posting optimal leetcode solutions in python though a public repository and believe in giving back to the tech community.

Feel free to check out my GitHub repositories to see some of my recent projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project!
